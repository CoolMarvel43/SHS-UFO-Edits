# Feet Fix

## Overview

This category has been spun off from Old Traditional, which I felt is very difficult to maintain, plus changing priorities.

This category only contains any "UD (Universal Design)"-style fixes that could potentially improve glyph quality in Source Han Sans. However, Adobe does not see this as a high-priority issue, hence why I have to fix it myself. The locales follow that of Source Han Sans (with KR, CN, TW and HK having a dot suffix, while JP doesn't), so if there are any glyphs with custom orthography, the fixes would already have been applied anyway.

## How it works

For any "feet" in 口, 山 and similar components (let's say A) placed on top, if there is any component at the bottom, the feet may be removed (or only the right side, depending on where it’s placed). If the B component is on the right side, while A is on the left, and the strokes of B can get in the way of A, only the right feet may be removed in A.
