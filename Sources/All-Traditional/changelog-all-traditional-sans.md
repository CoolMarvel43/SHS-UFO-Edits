# Changelog for All Traditional Sans

## 2025-10-28 *(v0.002)*

*This is a quality-of-life update, includes several new characters, which includes the new modern (MN) forms of the 食 radical that follows commercial conventions and the 口 radical covering commonly used Traditional Chinese character sets. The update also standardises the position and design of the 口 component on existing characters to match Adobe-designed JP glyphs. Some miscellaneous fixes and additions are also included.*

### Glyphs renamed
| Glyph name        | Character | Reason |
| ----------------- | --------- | ------ |
| *uni63DE* -> **uni63DE.CL1** | 揞 | Naming consistency; horizontal stroke 音 component (Inherited Glyphs form) should be under CL1 as vertical stroke 音 (same as JP forms) is the default Classic form, but that means this glyph is now unencoded in OTF and TTF fonts. The vertical stroke version is found under V1 Revival Sans. |

### Glyphs removed
| Glyph name        | Character | Reason |
| ----------------- | --------- | ------ |
| uni6062 | 恢 | Unmodified uni6062uE0101-JP glyph at CID 62300 from Source Han Sans v2.005 mistakenly uploaded here. |
