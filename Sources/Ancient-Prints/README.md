# Ancient Prints

### Overview

This category consists of variant Chinese characters as they appeared in historical Chinese books (which are not the Kangxi Dictionary), such as Guangyun (廣韻) and Hongwu Zhengyun (洪武正韻). Some of those forms ended up being used in 20th century metal type across China and Hong Kong 70s-80s phototypesetting.

These forms are considered "incorrect" by today's standards, and even in the Inherited Glyphs standard.

Originally intended to store "Hong Kong retro forms", apparently those forms actually go back further in time. And as for Hong Kong 70s-80s phototypesetting, not all the characters adopt the same variant components, with some characters adopting standard Japanese/Inherited forms instead. To make it easier to organise, it will be called "Ancient Prints". However, some characters may be indicated on whether they were used in HK phototypesetting.

While there may be some attempts to "standardise" on some components across characters, such variants may not even exist at all for some characters. Character set will be limited to most commonly used characters, although characters created outside of these lists in 2023-2024 will remain.

## Glyph naming

To avoid confusion, the production names of the glyphs do not follow what is in the [AI0-SourceHanSans](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-han-sans/blob/release/Resources/AI0-SourceHanSans) or [AI0-SourceHanSerif](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-han-serif/blob/release/Resources/AI0-SourceHanSerif) files.

Here are a list of glyph suffixes. The suffixes are prepended by a period rather than dashes. Not all characters are encoded.

- uniXXXX<span>.</span>alt1/alt2 - Alternate glyph shape
- uniXXXX<span>.</span>HK/HK2 - Unique Hong Kong glyph shape which is considered an errata. Despite being an anomaly, the glyph is placed here as majority of their characters usually adopt those ancient variants without so much as an "error". In addition, the new All Traditional repository will no longer host HK-specific errata glyphs.

## List of glyphs available

In the glyph lists, there will be an indication on whether HK phototypesetting used those forms.
