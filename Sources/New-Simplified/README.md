# New Simplified

## Overview

What if there is an alternate Simplified Chinese orthography that adopts semi-historical print forms that are better balanced than handwritten 新字形 forms? This is the place.

Inspired by Japanese shinjitai forms, this orthography format is intended to be a stylistic difference for Simplified Chinese rather than being a whole new standard altogether.

Please note that while this orthography format attempts to closely follow the Simplified Chinese conventions, it is never recommended for official use.

## Glyph policy

The intention is to provide a design compromise between handwritten Chinese standards and Japanese print standards. Inherited Glyph standards do not apply here.

While understandably there are fonts which apply old traditional orthography rules to simplified characters, this is considered anachronistic and to most people it seems alien and non-standard compliant.

So here is a brief description of how it will be:

- The first stroke in 亠 and 宀 is a vertical stroke, following JP printed forms, not a drop according to handwritten 新字形 rules.
- There is a split stroke in レ, 厶, following JP printed forms.
- 纟 will follow forms similar to commercial fonts like LiHei Pro (seen in the 糹 radical), and the first stroke of some components, like 言 and 户 (except for 所), will have a vertical stroke. 糸 will have a hook on the bottom vertical stroke.
- The 辶 radical will only have one dot following Japanese shinjitai forms. Should there be two dots to harmonise with Traditional characters, they will be placed in the All Traditional folder.

The characters are intended to only cover Simplified Chinese, such as the GB2312 and Tongyong Guifan standards. If Traditional characters are included in such a font, they will follow the modern forms in the All Traditional folder.
