# Kana Edits

This category consists of alternate Japanese kana designs for Sans.

All glyphs are labelled the same as what is in the [AI0-SourceHanSans file](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-han-sans/blob/release/Resources/AI0-SourceHanSans), to make it less confusing.

This was originally based on version 2.004. Any new additions will be based on v2.005 (or later), so the CID numbers (if you see it in the source files) from any future inclusions will be different from that of v2.004.

I have included the CID numbers of the respective glyphs for the latest version of Source Han Sans in case you need to integrate them directly.

The following glyphs are available (sorted according to source file glyph order):
| Production name  | Old nice names (as what Glyphs decided on) | Sans CID (as of v2.005) | Character            | Design change                            |
