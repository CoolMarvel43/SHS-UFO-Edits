# Kana Edits

This category consists of alternate Japanese kana designs. When opening the UFO file format, the glyphs are labelled in the same production names as the original Source Han Sans (as detailed in the [AI0-SourceHanSans file](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-han-sans/blob/release/Resources/AI0-SourceHanSans)). However, if you open the glyphspackage file, the nice names (for example: _o-kata_, _hoonSquare.vrt2_) will be shown instead, but the production names are still the same as what they are in Source Han Sans.

The following glyphs are available:
| Production name | Character |
|--|--|
| uni304D | き |
| uni304E | ぎ |
| uni3055 | さ |
| uni3056 | ざ |
| uni30AA | オ |
| uni30A9 | ォ |
| uni30DB | ホ |
| uni30DC | ボ |
| uni30DD | ポ |
| uniFF75 | ｵ |
| uniFF8E | ﾎ |
| uni3342 | ㍂ |
| uni331E | ㌞ |
| uni3342-V | ㍂ (vertical version, _hoonSquare.vrt2_) |
| uni331E-V | ㌞ (vertical version, _koopoSquare.vrt2_) |
| uni304Duni309A-V | _cid65466_ |
| uni30AAuni3099-V | _cid65474_ |

More to come in a future update, specifically the extra square katakana symbols not covered in Adobe-Japan1-3.
