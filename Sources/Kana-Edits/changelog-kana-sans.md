### Glyphs modified

All of the following characters are adjusted optically to be better looking.

| ---------- | -------------------- |

Furthermore, glyph names are now renamed to production names that follow the [AI0-SourceHanSans file](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-han-sans/blob/release/Resources/AI0-SourceHanSans) in both the UFO and glyphspackage formats.

OTF and TTF versions are now provided for easier integration.
