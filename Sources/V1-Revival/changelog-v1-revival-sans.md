# Changelog for V1 Revival Sans

## 2026-01-08 *(v0.003)*

*This is a minor update with adjustments to a few existing glyphs, and the addition of an unencoded uni8144\.CN 腄 glyph which is based on the original v1 uni8144-JP glyph.*

### Glyphs added

| Glyph name         | Character | Note |
| ------------------ | --------- | ---- |
| uni8144\.CN | 腄 | The original v1 uni8144-JP glyph (with very slight adjustments in ExtraLight) is coincidentally suitable for Mainland China conventions, so it is included alongside the adjusted uni8144 (in this repository) glyph. |

### Glyphs modified

| Glyph name | Character | Reason |
| ---------- | --------- | ------ |
| uni524E | 剎 | Used Chiukong Gothic as a base, but with slight adjustments as the original v1 JP glyph isn't actually well-designed |
| uni561F | 嘟 | Adjusted the left 口 radical and the right 都 component for better visual balance in ExtraLight |
| uni57BA | 垺 | Adjusted the 土 radical position to be more in line with Adobe-designed JP glyphs |
| uni6CB7 | 沷 | Fixed a minor outline bug in ExtraLight which was made when restoring the glyph; the original v1 JP glyph did not have the bug |
| uni7170 | 煰 | Increased width of top 口 component in right 品 component |
| uni833F | 茿 | Improved bezier quality of one of the rightmost strokes in the bottom-right 凡 component |


## 2025-10-23 *(v0.002)*

*This update fixes the position of the left 口 radical in most Iwata-designed v1 JP glyphs to match Adobe-designed JP glyphs.*
